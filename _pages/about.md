I am a senior undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Delhi. My research interests mainly lie in the area of Machine Learning, particularly in the following two areas: 

1. High-dimensional Machine Learning: How can we design effective algorithms for large-scale, high-dimensional data, with low time complexity? How can we apply these algorithms to real-life, noisy data? 

2. Explainable AI: How can we build models that are interpretable, robust, and generalizable? 

During my junior year, I interned at the Genome Institute of Singapore, where I worked with [Shyam Prabhakar](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/) on topics related to Single Cell Data Science. Before that, I spent my summer 2022 remotely interning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology with [Prof. Marco Chiesa](https://marchiesa.bitbucket.io/) where I worked on Data-Driven Network Connectivity.

At IIT Delhi, I have been working with [Prof. Jayadeva](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~jayadeva/) on Explainable AI and its applications to Genomics. I am also working with [Prof. Arpan Chattopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/site/arpanchattop/) on Adverserial Image Detection.

Aside from my research, I lead the student team at the Electrical Engineering Alumni Outreach Committee for â€˜22-23.

Often, the derivative of the objective function may not be possible to obtain. We developed an derivative-free algorithm to minimise mult-variable functions. 

Our method, based on Ant Colony Optimisation methods, works on minimising a wide range of functions. In particular, we apply our method to the Travelling Salesman Problem, Worst Case Circuit Analysis and Hyperparameter Tuning.

<span align ='center' style="color:DimGray; font-weight:700">Function Minimisation with Swarm Optimisation</span> <br>
We developed an derivative-free algorithm to minimise mult-variable functions. Often, information about the derivative of the objective function is unavailable, unreliable or impractical to obtain. For example, the function might be non-smooth or time-consuming to evaluate. 

Our method, based on Ant Colony Optimisation methods, works on minimising a wide range of functions. In particular, we apply our method to the Travelling Salesman Problem and Worst Case Circuit Analysis.
