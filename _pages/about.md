I am a senior undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Delhi. My research interests mainly lie in the area of Machine Learning, particularly in the following two areas: 

1. High-dimensional Machine Learning: How can we design effective algorithms for large-scale, high-dimensional data, with low time complexity? How can we apply these algorithms to real-life, noisy data? 

2. Explainable AI: How can we build models that are interpretable, robust, and generalizable? 

During my junior year, I interned at the Genome Institute of Singapore, where I worked with [Shyam Prabhakar](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/) on topics related to Single Cell Data Science. Before that, I spent my summer 2022 remotely interning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology with [Prof. Marco Chiesa](https://marchiesa.bitbucket.io/) where I worked on Data-Driven Network Connectivity.

At IIT Delhi, I have been working with [Prof. Jayadeva](https://web.iitd.ac.in/~jayadeva/) on Explainable AI and its applications to Genomics. I am also working with [Prof. Arpan Chattopadhyay](https://sites.google.com/site/arpanchattop/) on Adverserial Image Detection.

Aside from my research, I lead the student team at the Electrical Engineering Alumni Outreach Committee for â€˜22-23.

<span align ='center' style="color:DimGray; font-weight:700">Function Minimisation with Swarm Optimisation</span> <br>
Often, the derivative of the objective function may not be possible to obtain. We developed an derivative-free algorithm to minimise mult-variable functions. 

Our algorithm is based on Ant Colony Optimisation methods. We apply our method to the Travelling Salesman Problem, Worst Case Circuit Analysis and Hyperparameter Tuning.

<span align ='center' style="color:DimGray; font-weight:700">GraphUMAP</span> <br>
We developed GraphUMAP, a novel visualization technique for graph-structured data based on UMAP.  Popular visualization techniques like UMAP and tSNE do not utilise graph structure information. Our proposed method GraphUMAP produces visualizations which account for both graph structure and node features.
