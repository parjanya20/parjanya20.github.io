I am a senior undergraduate in the Electrical Engineering department at IIT Delhi. My research interests mainly lie in the area of Machine Learning, particularly in the following two areas: 

1. High-dimensional Machine Learning: How can we design effective algorithms for large-scale, high-dimensional data, with low time complexity? How can we apply these algorithms to real-life, noisy data? 

2. Explainable AI: How can we build models that are interpretable, robust, and generalizable? 

During my junior year, I interned at the Genome Institute of Singapore, where I worked with Shyam Prabhakar on topics related to Single Cell Data Science. Before that, I spent my summer 2022 remotely interning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology with Prof. Marco Chiesa where I worked on Data-Driven Network Connectivity.

At IIT Delhi, I have been lucky to work with Prof. Jayadeva on Explainable AI and its applications to Genomics. I have also had the fortune of working with Prof. Arpan Chattopadhyay on Adverserial Image Detection.

Aside from my research, I lead the student team at the Electrical Engineering Alumni Outreach Committee for â€˜22-23.
