I am a first-year Master's student in the ECE Department at UCSD. I completed my undergrad from IIT Delhi. My research interests like in Probabilstic AI and Causal AI. At UCSD, I currently work with [Prof. Babak Salimi](https://bsalimi.github.io/) on Distribution shifts and Causal Inference and with [Prof. Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com/) on Causal Discovery. In the past, I interned at the Genome Institute of Singapore, where I worked with [Shyam Prabhakar](https://prabhakarlab.github.io/) on topics related to Single Cell Data Science.

<span align ='center' style="color:DimGray; font-weight:700">Function Minimisation with Swarm Optimisation</span> <br>
Often, the derivative of the objective function may not be possible to obtain. We developed an derivative-free algorithm to minimise mult-variable functions. Our algorithm is based on Ant Colony Optimisation methods. We apply our method to the Travelling Salesman Problem, Worst Case Circuit Analysis and Hyperparameter Tuning.

<span align ='center' style="color:DimGray; font-weight:700">GraphUMAP</span> <br>
We developed GraphUMAP, a novel visualization technique for graph-structured data based on UMAP.  Popular visualization techniques like UMAP and tSNE do not utilise graph structure information. Our proposed method GraphUMAP produces visualizations which account for both graph structure and node features.

The emerging diversity of single-cell RNA-seq datasets allows for the full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. However, it is challenging to analyze them together because technical and biological variation are interspersed. 
We are working on a novel iterative data integration algorithm for this task.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer. Our goal was to find a multiple sets of marker genes to be used in a clinical lab test for colorectal cancer subtyping. We found several sets of marker genes and now are in the process of performing clinical trials.

<br>
<br>
Tree Type Neural Networks are an intrinsically interpretable neural architecture. Most AI models, especially neural networks, are "black box" models, where there is little transparency to how and why the models make the predictions they do, making it hard for humans to trust these models. We developed a model that combines an SVM-based decision-tree model with learned neural network features.
