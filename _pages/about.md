I am an incoming PhD student in the Data Science Department (HDSI) at UC San Diego, advised by [Prof. Babak Salimi](https://bsalimi.github.io/) and [Prof. Biwei Huang](https://biweihuang.com/). My research interests broadly focus on trustworthy machine learning (data attribution, memorization, causality). I hold Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical Engineering from IIT Delhi and UC San Diego, respectively.
